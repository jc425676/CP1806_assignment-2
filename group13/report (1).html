<h3>Progress and final thoughts</h3>
<li><h4>For the progress of the website our team member contributed for each part of the website from the template, javascript and the content of the website. Our team member has made a progress from the 1st milestone to the 2nd milestone. We added contents to make the website look more presentable by adding contents. We also add javascript for the order form and the feedback form.  Our team member worked hard to lay out all the content and improve the website from the 1st milestone to the final and finished website. </h4></li>
<h3>Usability testing</h3>
<li><h4>For the usability testing, we ask several groups to test our final website. We got several feedbacks from the groups and for the overall website they think our website was satisfied. But there are some feedbacks which have some issues and need improvement. The group commented issues for the website such as adding more information add color to make it more attractive, etc.</h4>
<h3>References</h3>
<li><H4>The login and register page would not work as it is just an add-on for touch up. The products page would have a description and the price of the product to make customer aware what the product is and the price. The feedback and the order form will be under the contact us page. The order form and the feedback form includes javascript.</H4></li>
<h3>PMI(Plus, Minuses and interesting aspects)</h3>
<li><h4>For the plus side we had all the work done nicely and the website overall is satisfying. We worked hard to make the website presentable.</h4></li>
<li><h4>For the minuses we had some problem with the navbar as the logo wont align with the navbar. We took three days to work it out.</h4></li>
<li><h4>The interesting part while doing or project is that we did our website ahead of time.</h4></li>
